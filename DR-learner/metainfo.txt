The data structure has to be the following: 

- y = outcome variable
- d = treatment variable
- covariates = the covariates to map on d or y
- learners = the machine learning methods to use in the [SuperLearner package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SuperLearner/vignettes/Guide-to-SuperLearner.html).
